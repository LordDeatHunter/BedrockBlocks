# Bedrock Blocks
Make blocks unbreakable via the config.
Simply add them in the form of `modname:block_name` inside `config/bedrockblocks/disabled_blocks.json`
To make certain players bypass this restriction, simply add them to the whitelist inside `config/bedrockblocks/whitelisted_players.json`
After changing the configs, either restart the game, or run the `reloadbedrockblocks` command
